> ! Attention: This Library is highly under development (Alpha Version)

**enjine** ships the most sophisticated technologies to build interoperable applications out of the box! The approach is to make developing ready to use application even for beginners and professionals.

This Library bundles all modern web and app development standards right away.

There is no need to install any webserver, database and other out of nodejs services. Everything is shipped, so you can focus on developing the app, without all crunchy stuff, which costs time and energy.

To do so, there are multiple ways you can choose for developing applications. For example you can fill application templates made by the community with content, customize them or developing and sharing your own template and modules.

**enjine** is lovely based on
