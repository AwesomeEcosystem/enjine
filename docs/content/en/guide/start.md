## Start new Project

For developing a full project including the *Homepage*, *Documentation*, reusable *Modules* and the *Application* itself, we recommend to use the **Project Monorepository Template**

> More options coming soon

```bash
npx create-enjine-app <Your Project Name>
cd <Your Project Name>
```
Once the monorepository is initialized, you can work on the fallowing repositories
